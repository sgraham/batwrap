batwrap
-------

A binary that forwards to an existing .bat file. This allows calling a program
named 'wee' and just having it in the path, but using 'wee' in the
lpApplicationName position for CreateProcess. Otherwise, it needs to be
prefixed with "cmd /c" or similar.

To use, just build, and then rename batwrap.exe to whatever.exe. Then, running
whatever.exe will run whatever.bat under cmd.
